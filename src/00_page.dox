\mainpage  ARMAS matrix library

Simple column major matrix package and basic linear algebra subroutine (BLAS) implementation
with selected functionality from LAPACK linear algebra package. 

This library aims for single code base implementation of single and double precision real 
and complex versions of all supported functions. The implementation is inspired by libFLAME.

BLAS code supports 
 - level 1, 2 and 3 BLAS 
 - multi-threaded implementation of BLAS3 functions
 - SIMD accelerated for x86_64 
 - extended presicion versions of most BLAS functions. Implementation based on
   error free transformations as descripted by Ogita 2005.
 - configurable blocking parameters for BLAS3 functions

LAPACK functions
 - unblocked and blocked versions with configurable blocking factor
 - provides following factorization and solvers
   - QR family (QR, LQ, QL and RQ)
   - LU with partial pivoting
   - Cholesky
   - Bunch-Kaufman LDL factorization of symmetric matrices
   - SVD factorization
   - Symmetric EVD
 - other functionality
   - Hessenberg reduction
   - Bidiagonal reduction
   - Tridiagonal reduction
   - Givens rotations
   - Random Butterfly transformations
