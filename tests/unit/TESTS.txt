Error measuring as in LAPACK User Guide, section 4 (Accuracy and Stability), we compute
relative error as ||A_orig - A_computed||_1/||A_orig||_1 and number of correct digits
by ceil(log10(1.0/e_rel))

In the following relative error is meant by ||A - B|| where A is the original and B
computed value.

QR-family of factorization:

   1. ||unblk.QR - blk.QR|| ~ eps
      Factoring: unblocked and blocked version are equal

   2. ||I - Q.T*Q*I|| ~ eps
      Multiplication from left: matrix Q orthogonal

   3. ||C - Q.T*Q*C|| ~ eps
      Multiplication from left: matrix Q orthogonal

   4. ||C - C*Q.T*Q|| ~ eps
      Multiplication from right: matrix Q orthogonal

   5. ||I - Q.T*Q|| ~ eps, where Q = buildQ(qr(A))
      Reconstruction Q; is orthogonal

   6. ||I - Q*Q.T|| ~ eps, where Q = buildQ(qr(A))
      Reconstruction Q; is orthogonal


QR, LQ solvers:

   7. least squares - min ||B - A*X||

   8. min ||X|| s.t A.T*X = B
      compute || B - A.T*(A.-T*B) || ~ 0
