Here are FLOPs counts for a number of recent processor microarchitectures and explanation how to achieve them:

Intel Core 2 and Nehalem:

    4 DP FLOPs/cycle: 2-wide SSE2 addition + 2-wide SSE2 multiplication
    8 SP FLOPs/cycle: 4-wide SSE addition + 4-wide SSE multiplication

Intel Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge:

    8 DP FLOPs/cycle: 4-wide AVX addition + 4-wide AVX multiplication
    16 SP FLOPs/cycle: 8-wide AVX addition + 8-wide AVX multiplication

Intel Haswell:

    16 DP FLOPs/cycle: two 4-wide FMA (fused multiply-add) instructions
    32 SP FLOPs/cycle: two 8-wide FMA (fused multiply-add) instructions

AMD K10:

    4 DP FLOPs/cycle: 2-wide SSE2 addition + 2-wide SSE2 multiplication

    2 DP FLOPs/cycle: scalar FMA or scalar multiply-add
    8 SP FLOPs/cycle: 4-wide NEONv2 FMA or 4-wide NEON multiply-add

Qualcomm Krait:

    2 DP FLOPs/cycle: scalar FMA or scalar multiply-add
    8 SP FLOPs/cycle: 4-wide NEONv2 FMA or 4-wide NEON multiply-add
