Integrate double precision complex to blas1/2/3 code base
 - Handling of CONJUGATE transpose within kernel functions
 - Per instruction set optimizations.
 - Unit tests for BLAS1/2/3 functionality

Complex versions of lapack functionality
 - requires proper handling of conjugate tranpose in blas-functions

Per instruction set optimizations for single precision floats and complex numbers

Matrix I/O
 - functions for reading and writing matrices from files
 - marshalling/unmarshalling for transmission

Unit testing for all supported types

Automake
 - instruction set testing for compilation
 - use of config.h (not used, should it?)
 - library selection, all or only some versions

Missing lapack functionality
 - Eigenvalue computations
 - Singular value decomposition
 - Condition numbers estimation
 - ...

Multi-threading support
 - replace current simplistic implementation with something better
